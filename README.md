# BONSAI - Take care of your mind

Grow virtual bonsai trees that represent projects and skills you're developing! Bonsai may be the accountability you need to improve and succeed.

## Step One: Create your bonsai tree

You can add any details about your project 
so that all of your information is in one place and easily accessible.

## Step Two: Care for your bonsai tree

These trees have life cycles, growth and decay. By default the tree must be worked on every day for at least one hour. This can be tailored to fit the exact needs of your project. With the default life cycle, the tree will begin to wither after one day of no work done. And by the third day it will wither away for ever and lose all accumulated points

## Step Three: Accumulate points for your tree

With each project, you will have tasks that need done. Take some time (it may be less than you think) and try to detail the basic tasks you'll need to complete over the duration of this project. You can set one-time tasks, or repeated tasks that will re-appear after they've been completed for the day. Each task you complete will gain that tree a point! This is mainly a statistic for you to use and track your progress and growth. It's great to feel good about all the work you've done!

## Step Four: View your progress

Bonsai gives you a helpful report with statistics about your productivity. You will be able to view your hours logged in a week/month period, your tree farm and lifetime points, your bonsai streak, and more.
